# Project-OpenCV-

<table>
  
**In this project We will using OpenCV to do the following stuffs:<br></br>
a) access camera in opencv <br></br>
b) read a video in opencv <br></br>
c)write a video in opencv <br></br>
d)apply filter in webcame video for canny, blur and feature detection.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand Computer Vision and OpenCV First**...<br></br>

**What is Computer Vision?** <br></br>

Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images,
and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions.<br></br>


**What is OpenCV**?<br></br>

OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage, then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and licensed as free and open-source software under Apache License<br></br>

**Important Note: I have added "nature.mp4" but you are free to add any video of your choice**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
